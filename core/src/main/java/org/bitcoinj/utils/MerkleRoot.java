        // entry is a hash.
        //
        // The hashing algorithm is double SHA-256. The leaves are a hash of the serialized contents of the transaction.
        // The interior nodes are hashes of the concenation of the two child hashes.
        //
        // This structure allows the creation of proof that a transaction was included into a block without having to
        // provide the full block contents. Instead, you can provide only a Merkle branch. For example to prove tx2 was
        // in a block you can just provide tx2, the hash(tx1) and B. Now the other party has everything they need to
        // derive the root, which can be checked against the block header. These proofs aren't used right now but

        // tx3 above). A tree with 5 transactions would look like this:
